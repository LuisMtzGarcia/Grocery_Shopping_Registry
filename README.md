The site is hosted on Heroku, please be patient with the dyno's wake-up time.

## Introduction
This project aims to offer users a simple and effective way to register and track 
their shopping expenses.

Purchases have the following attributes:
* Name of the product
* Category
* Quantity bought
* Total price of the purchase
* Bulk purchase or not

Users have two options to visualize their purchases:
* By day, which displays the purchases made on a certain day.
* By month, which displays all the purchases made in the desired month.

This was a practice project aimend on building a CRUD application and deepening 
my handling of the back-end and the front-end of a website.
